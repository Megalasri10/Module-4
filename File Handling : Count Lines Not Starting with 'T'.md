# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def count_lines_not_starting_with_t(filename):
    count = 0
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                line = line.strip()
                if line and not line.startswith('T'):
                    count += 1
        print(f"Number of lines not starting with 'T': {count}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")
count_lines_not_starting_with_t('story.txt')
```
